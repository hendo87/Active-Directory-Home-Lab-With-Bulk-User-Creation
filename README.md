For the Virtual Machine that will be hosting my Domain Controller, I need two network adapters. I need the NAT that will use my host IP address from my home router and an Internal Network Adapter so that my DC can communicate with other Virtual Machines. For the Internal Network I will be using VMnet0. Refer to the diagram at the beginning

After downloading Windows Server 2019 on the Virtual Machine the first thing I have to do is configure the two network Adapters I have. One is the external NIC and one is the Internal NIC
